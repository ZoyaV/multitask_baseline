# SampleFactory APPO baseline for Iglu

## Idea
There are many ways to build a structure in IGLU environment. To overcome this, we split the whole
system from the agentsâ€™ perspective into three modules: a task generator module, a subtask generator
module, and a subtask solving module. We define the subtask as an episode
of adding or removing a single cube. It allows us to train an agent with a dense reward signal in
episodes with a short horizon.

**Task generator module** generate full target(3D voxel) figure using dialogue with person. For training we devlop; For training we use randomly generated compact structures as tasks.

**Subtask generator** receives a 3D voxel as input and outputs a sequence of subgoals (remove or install one cube) in a certain sequence (left to right, bottom to top);

**Subtask solving module** APPO agent who is learning the task of adding or removing one cube.

## Code structure

Now, function `target_to_subtasks` in wrappers/target_generator.py implements the main algorithm for splitting the goal into subtasks
Also, in  `wrappers/multitask` you can find `TargetGenerator` and `SubtaskGenerator` classes.
First class make full-figure target using `RandomFigure` generator or `DatasetFigure` generator.
Second class make subtasks for environment.

## Installation
For this baseline version uses branch ```segments``` from Iglu gridworld repository. You can install this version by the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/iglu-contest/gridworld.git@segments
```

Just install all dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r docker/requirements.txt
```

## Training APPO
Just run ```train.py``` with config_path:
```bash
python main.py --config_path iglu_baseline.yaml
```
## Enjoy baseline
Run ```enjoy.py``` :
```bash
python utils/enjoy.py
```


## Per-skill aggregation of the baselines performance metrics. 
For each task, we calculate F1 score between built and target structures. 
For each skill, we average the performance on all targets requiring that skill.

| F1 score        | flying |tall |diagonal | flat   | tricky | all  |
|-----------------| ----- | -----| -------|--------|-------|------|
| MHB agent (NLP) | 0.292 | 0.322 | 0.242  |  0.334 | 0.295 | 0.313 |
| MHB agent (full)| 0.233 |0.243  | 0.161  |0.290   |  0.251|  0.258|
| Random agent (full)| 0.039|0.036  | 0.044  |0.038   |  0.043|  0.039|
